# Title: Comparing DNA Sequences

Problem Description:
In genetics, identifying common patterns within DNA sequences is crucial for understanding evolutionary relationships between species. Your task is to find the
Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two DNA sequences. The LCS represents the longest sequence of characters (nucleotides) that are shared between two 
DNA sequences, allowing researchers to identify common genetic information.

Example:

Input:
Sequence 1: AGGTAB
Sequence 2: GXTXAYB

Output:
Length of LCS: 4
LCS: GTAB

Constraints:

.The input sequences consist of characters representing nucleotides: A, C, G, and T.
.The maximum length of each input sequence is 1000 characters.
.Both input sequences may have different lengths.
.The input sequences may contain lowercase or uppercase characters.
