# Assignment: Optimizing Delivery Routes for a Multi-Depot Logistics Company

Problem Description:
You have been hired as a consultant for a logistics company that operates multiple depots and provides delivery services to various locations. The company aims to optimize its delivery routes to minimize the total distance traveled by its delivery trucks, thus reducing fuel costs and improving efficiency.

The company has several depots, each serving a set of delivery locations. Each truck must start from its assigned depot, visit all delivery locations assigned to that depot, and return to the starting point. Additionally, the optimization must consider constraints such as maximum route lengths due to fuel limits, specific time windows for deliveries, and varying truck capacities.

Your task is to develop an optimization solution that finds the most efficient routes for the trucks from each depot, minimizing the total distance traveled while adhering to the given constraints.


Iterative Processes:
In optimization problems like this, iterative processes are employed to progressively improve a solution. Starting with an initial solution, we iteratively make small adjustments to the routes in an attempt to find a better (shorter) total distance. These adjustments, or "mutations," might include swapping locations within a route, moving locations between routes, reversing segments of routes, and shifting locations within routes.

Over many iterations, these small changes can lead to significant improvements in the solution. This approach mimics the process of natural selection, where better solutions are "selected" and "mutated" to produce increasingly efficient routes. This method falls under the broader category of metaheuristic optimization techniques, which are widely used to solve complex real-world problems.


Input:

Depots: A list of depot coordinates, each representing a starting and ending point for a truck.
Delivery Locations: A list of coordinates for all delivery locations.
Assignments: A mapping of each delivery location to its assigned depot.
Constraints (optional, based on complexity):
Maximum Route Length: The maximum allowable distance for any route.
Time Windows: Specific time frames within which deliveries must be made.
Truck Capacities: The maximum load capacity for each truck.


Output:

Optimized Routes: The most efficient route for each truck, starting and ending at their respective depots and visiting all assigned delivery locations.
Total Distance: The total distance traveled for each route and the combined distance for all routes.
