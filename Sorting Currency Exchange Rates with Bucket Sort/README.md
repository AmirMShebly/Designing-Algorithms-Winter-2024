# Title: Bucket Sort for Currency Exchange Rates

Problem Description:
You are a financial analyst working for a currency exchange company, and you need to sort a list of currency exchange rates in ascending order.
Each exchange rate is represented as a floating-point number indicating the exchange rate of one currency to another.

Your task is to implement a function bucket_sort_exchange_rates(rates:List[float]) -> List[float] that sorts the exchange rates using the Bucket Sort algorithm.

The Bucket Sort algorithm works by distributing the elements into a fixed number of buckets, sorting each bucket individually, and then concatenating the sorted buckets to obtain the final sorted list.

Your function should return the sorted list of exchange rates.

Example:
Input: exchange_rates = [1.5, 0.9, 1.2, 1.8, 1.0, 1.3]
Output: [0.9, 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.8]

Constraints:
1 <= len(rates) <= 1000 0.0 <= rates[i] <= 10.0
Bucket Sort is efficient for sorting data that is uniformly distributed, such as currency exchange rates.
